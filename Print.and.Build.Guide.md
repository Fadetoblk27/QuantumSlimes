# V4 Print and Build Guide
So you want to build a QuantumSlime tracker huh? Well, you've come to the right place.

## What files to print
You will need to print [`V4.Case.Top.stl`](https://github.com/Quantum-Red/QuantumSlimes/blob/main/V4/V4.Case.Top.stl), [`V4.Case.Bottom.stl`](https://github.com/Quantum-Red/QuantumSlimes/blob/main/V4/V4.Case.Bottom.stl), and [`V4.Components.Plate.stl`](https://github.com/Quantum-Red/QuantumSlimes/blob/main/V4/V4.Components.Plate.stl) for the case, and then a [mounting plate](https://github.com/Quantum-Red/QuantumSlimes/tree/main/V4/Mounting%20Plates) to be able to attach the tracker to your body. Choose from one of the [already available mounting plates](https://github.com/Quantum-Red/QuantumSlimes/tree/main/V4/Mounting%20Plates) or download and modify [`V4.Template.Mounting.Plate.stl`](https://github.com/Quantum-Red/QuantumSlimes/blob/main/V4/Mounting%20Plates/V4.Template.Mounting.Plate.stl) to design your own mounting solution. If you do end up making your own design, please share it with the community by uploading it in a pull request to the [mounting plates directory](https://github.com/Quantum-Red/QuantumSlimes/tree/main/V4/Mounting%20Plates).

## Recommended printer settings
For `V4.Case.Top.stl`, `V4.Case.Bottom.stl`, and `V4.Components.Plate.stl`, these are the settings I recommend:
Layer height | 0.16mm
:--- | :---:
**Infill density** | **15-30%**
**Print cooling** | **yes**
**Generate support** | **no**
**Build plate adhesion** | **none**

For `Mounting Plate`, these are the settings I recommend:
Layer height | 0.16mm
:--- | :---:
**Infill density** | **100%**
**Print cooling** | **no**
**Generate support** | **yes**
**Build plate adhesion** | **none**

Any other print settings will be up to you and what works best for your printer and material.

## Assembly
So now that you've got all your parts printed out and all your electronics have arrived in the mail, it's time to start putting it all together into a working tracker!

Tools you'll need:
- Soldering iron
- Solder
- 24 gauge wire
- Wire strippers (or scissors/knife if you're very, *very* careful)
- M3 allen wrench/hex key
- Soldering station or helping hands (optional, but highly recommended)

_Now let's get started!_

### Step 1
Bruh I'm tired I'ma go to sleep and finish writing this later lol
